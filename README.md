# Flickr Search â€“ Angular example application

ðŸ“– This example is part of the **[free online book: Testing Angular â€“ A Guide to Robust Angular Applications

This is an Angular example application implementing a Flickr photo search. There is one version with plain Angular and one version with [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/).

The application is fully tested with unit and end-to-end tests.

Unit tests are written in plain Angular using `TestBed` and additionally using [Spectator](https://github.com/ngneat/spectator).

End-to-end tests are written with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and also with [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
